## Project Notes — “Forest + AI”

### App Overview

A study-timer app based on the Pomodoro technique. It tracks focus metrics, visualizes session data, enforces optional app-usage restrictions, and includes gamification: each completed session contributes to building a virtual house/room/structure.

- Idea: context of the user (e.g. environment where the user is studying/working -> noise, location data, proximity to other devices, # of phone pick-ups via `pick_up_gesture`) understand when a user is more productive in order to suggest the best time/place to work/study

### Purpose

- Improve concentration during work or study  
- Record and visualize daily routines and productivity patterns  
- Provide actionable insights through AI-driven habit analysis  
- Encourage digital detox by limiting distractions  
- Support any repetitive or time-boxed activity (studying, chores, cleaning, etc.)

### Additional information / tasks

- find relevant papers (AI + **how to measure productivity** / focus)
  - important factors that influence productivity
